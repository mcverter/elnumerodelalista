The cooler is very ugly. <BR/>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   It is a cold place where you can not sleep because the light is on 24 hours during the time
   Intentionally, you will lose the notion of time, there is a room that in theory is where
   people receive food, food is horrible, it's cold. <BR/>
   You sleep (try to sleep) on the floor or on the metal benches where hardly anyone can sleep. <BR/>
   You must drink recycled water from toilets that is harmful to your stomach. <BR/>
   When you use the bathrooms you have to do it in front of others. <BR/>
   Also in each cell they have around 10 to 15 people at most. That in a small space as in
   4 meters long by 3 meters of hancho.

When a foreigner lives with you in your land, you must not oppress him. <BR/>
You must regard the foreigner who lives with you as the native-born among you. You are to love him as yourself, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.

      What do the anarchists think about this process?

         <BLOCKQUOTE>
This in itself is enough for a social revolution which is economic in na¬ture and anti-authoritarian, but there is more. Four million Indians live in Mexico who, until twenty or twenty-five years ago, lived in communities possessing the lands, the waters, and the forests in common. Mutual aid was the rule in these communities, in which authority was felt only when the tax collcctor appeared periodically or when "recruiters" showed up in search of men to force into the army. In these communities there were no judges, mayors, jailers, in fact no bothersome people at all of this type. Everyone had the right to the land, to the water to irrigate it, to the forests for firewood, and to the wood from the forests for the construction of small houses.The plows passed from hand to hand, as did yokes of oxen. Each family worked as much land as they thought was sufficient to pro¬duce what was necessary, and the work of weeding and harvesting was done in common by the entire community—today, Pedro's harvest, tomorrow Juan s, and so on. Everyone in the community put their hands to the work when a house was to be raised.

            My friend or relative already crossed into the United States. Where is she right now?
`, `
            Possibly, she is being detained in the United States <BR/>
Right after a person crosses the border they go into the hielera.  They stay there for as long as two weeks.  There is no way to get information about them.<BR />

After this, they might go into ICE detention<BR/>
Here is the official page for search for them: <BR/>
<A href="https://locator.ice.gov/odls">Online Detainee Locator System - ICE</A><BR/>
It is very hard to use.  ICE is a racist, fascist organization.  They do not care about human beings<BR/>
I am trying to search for people too, but it is very difficult<BR>
